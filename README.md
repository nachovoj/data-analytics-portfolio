# Data Analytics Portfolio — Ignacio Vélez Ocampo

This repository serves as the **main index** of my Data Analytics Portfolio.  
Its purpose is to **showcase my technical and analytical skills** through a collection of reproducible projects that combine **data engineering, analysis, and business understanding**.

The portfolio demonstrates my ability to design complete data workflows—from **collection and integration** to **modeling and visualization**—while applying best practices in reproducibility, documentation, and code organization.  
It reflects both the technical depth and strategic thinking I bring to analytical problem-solving.

Each project is hosted in its own repository, with a dedicated environment, Quarto documentation, and clear execution instructions.

Each project repository includes:
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining objectives, workflow, and results  
- Organized folder structure (`data/`, `reports/`, `figures/`, etc.)  
- Reproducible code and environment specifications (`requirements.txt`)  

This structure ensures transparency, scalability, and full reproducibility across all portfolio components, while providing a comprehensive view of my technical skill set in data analytics.
